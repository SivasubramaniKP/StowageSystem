    Cargo Stowage system
        To manage cargo inside a space station
        Automate the process and workflow

    
    Cargo includes
        Consumables : Food, water, medicine
        Equipments : tool, equipments, spare parts, mission specific hardware
        Payload : Instruments and experiment sample

    Functional Requirements : 
        The application should suggest where to place the new cargo based on space availability, priority and accessiblity

        Quick retrieval of Items 
        3. Rearrangement Optimization – If a new incoming shipment causes space shortage, it should
        suggest rearranging certain items to optimize space usage.

        4. Waste Disposal Management – When items become unusable (expired or fully used), the
        system should:
        ○ Automatically categorize them as waste.
        ○ Suggest which container to move the waste into for undocking.
        
        5. Cargo Return Planning – Before a resupply module undocks, the system should provide a
        clear plan for waste return and space reclamation.

        6. Logging all the actions performed by the astronauts
        
        7. Make sure the algorithms you use are efficient, as power and compute is a valuable resource

        in space, your scores also depend on this and above mentioned factors. (Rubrics given below)
